# FinAI - Python Test

This project's purpouse was to create a script able to obtain characters usage statistics on FinAI website (https://www.finai.pl/blog), from the first 20 titles each 10 minutes repeating the process. It was suppose to also store the latest 5 fetches to the website. I chose to do in .txt format.
Executable can be find in the /dist/ folder for testing purpouses. The .txt file will be created in the same folder as the executable.
Comments are present in the code to help you understand the thought process.
